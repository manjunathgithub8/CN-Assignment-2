Instructions to run program:
    -there are two programs 1)receiver.py   2)sender.py
**imp -First, receiver.py should be compiled and after that sender.py
    
   -format :
           -receiver.py - python receiver.py <maxseq> <K> <Port>
                example   python receiver.py 8 6 20040
            
           -sender.py - python sender.py <w> <maxseq> <n> <I> <time> <ip> <port>
               example  python sender.py 6 8 19 4 2 192.168.2.5 20040
 
 note: i have implemented packet loss in sender side only , hence <I> is required to be sent in sender program only.

 
Working: GBN protocol using Socket programming and msg receiving and sending


Challenges Faced: -implementing timeout
                  -keeping track for resending packets
